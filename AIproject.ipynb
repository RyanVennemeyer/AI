They have basically dominated the globe and the bull run that started after the 2008 crisis is due to their success. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you can find a place on developed world where someone never heard of an iPhone, or an office that never used Excel, or an Adobe product, or doesn&amp;#39;t have an Instagram, or doesn&amp;#39;t check Amazon to buy something etc. There are many more examples. And no, this was not the norm before the last 10-15 years, not this much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Lets look at the revenue growth of some huge &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; companies in Nasdaq index.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amazon: 2009 - 24 billion, 2022 - 469 billion\\nApple: 2009 - 42 billion, 2022 - 365 billion\\nGoogle: 2009 - 23 billion, 2022 - 257 billion\\nMicrosoft: 2009 - 58 billion, 2022 - 168 billion\\nMeta: 2009 - 0.7 billion, 2022 - 117 billion&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So when a company increases their global revenue up to 10, 20, 30 times what do you think will happen to its stock? How is their huge global success all over the world is just because of Fed&amp;#39;s QE? Are people in Europe using Instagram on their iPhone&amp;#39;s they bought from Amazon because of the Fed?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;American companies had an incredibly successful decade and the bull run is perfectly in line with this.

Once people stop paying sky high prices for assets and commodities, prices will come back down. I think this will happen relatively soon.\\n\\nA simple look at the stock market is a prime example. The market is forward looking like I said. People are not willing to pay high multiples of companies due to slower growth in the future.

With the current Fed rate at 0.25%. Likely to go up to 0.75% on Tuesday, May 3rd.

However this route will end inflation quicker, so the market can go back to normal once the dust settles.\\n\\nAgain, all the Fed has done so far is mostly talk. They haven't really taken much action yet as far as tightening goes. I'd say the market is currently pricing in Fed rates of around 3% which is taking us well into 2023.

Once the bull market resumes, make sure you are on the train.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': True, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01', 'can_gild': True, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'call_to_action': '', 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qjfk', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#646d73', 'id': 'ufxal8', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'animoshpit', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 9, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/stocks/comments/ufxal8/the_stock_market_is_the_greatest_tool_to_build/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ufxal8/the_stock_market_is_the_greatest_tool_to_build/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 3969938, 'created_utc': 1651401953.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}\n",

However they are trading at high valuation which means the market is expecting high growth which might be true but is this likely? If they already have a monopoly in this sector (outside China) where will the additional growth come from? Ad revenue is the main one but as entrenched as they are it feels like therr are vulnerable points like changes in regulation or technology which makes advertising less valuable etc etc.From my limited understanding they are invested in other sectors too such as AI so what is the expected growth in this sector and what percentage would google take? \\n\\n\\n\\nApple - Smartphone giants, smartphones seem like they will always be a huge part of society. Also apple are looking into other sectors such as TV or electric cars. However if smart phone are only increasing 2% that would mean if Apple were to grow beyond 2% per year they would need to take market share from their competitors\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD - Not sure if the valuation is high or not.

However they are trading at high valuation which means the market is expecting high growth which might be true but is this likely? If they already have a monopoly in this sector (outside China) where will the additional growth come from? Ad revenue is the main one but as entrenched as they are it feels like therr are vulnerable points like changes in regulation or technology which makes advertising less valuable etc etc.From my limited understanding they are invested in other sectors too such as AI so what is the expected growth in this sector and what percentage would google take? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Apple - Smartphone giants, smartphones seem like they will always be a huge part of society. Also apple are looking into other sectors such as TV or electric cars. However if smart phone are only increasing 2% that would mean if Apple were to grow beyond 2% per year they would need to take market share from their competitors&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;AMD - Not sure if the valuation is high or not.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\\n\\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 2nd, 2022.\\n\\n# **Seasonal trends could be a drag on a stock market that needs a rebound - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/seasonal-trends-could-be-a-drag-on-a-stock-market-that-needs-a-rebound.html)**\\n*****\\n&gt; Investors will be looking for a reprieve after the worst month for stocks in more than two years, but the calendar might not be too friendly from here.\\n*****\\n&gt; Rising interest rates, some high-profile earnings misses and burgeoning concerns about global growth took a toll on the stock market in April.\\n*****\\n&gt; The big drawdown comes on the eve of a historically weak period for stocks, with the “sell in May and go away” mindset officially beginning next week. According to the Stock Traders Almanac, an investor who held the Dow Jones Industrial Average between Nov. 1 and April 30, and then switched to fixed income for the next six months, would have produced solid returns with reduced risk for more than seven decades now.\\n*****\\n&gt; That seasonal weakness can be especially pronounced in midterm election years, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\\n*****\\n&gt; “Sometimes it has paid to lock in gains ahead of the traditionally challenging May-through-October periods. And this particularly goes for midterm election years, also known as ‘sophomore slumps.’ Indeed, since 1992, the S&amp;P 500 fell an average 3.4% in the May-through-October period of midterm election years,” Stovall said in a note to clients Monday.\\n*****\\n&gt; However, jumping to fixed income, as the simple strategy suggests, might not be smartest move.\\n*****\\n“Cashing out might not be the best option either, since equal exposure to the defensive consumer staples and health care sectors from May through October outpaced the broader benchmark 100% of these years and posted an average six-month total return of 5.6%,” Stovall wrote.\\n*****\\n&gt; # Did May selling come early?\\n&gt; To be sure, those defensive sectors Stovall highlighted have already been outperforming in recent weeks.\\n*****\\n&gt; And what about the tech sector, which has been sliding for nearly six months now? Some metrics and market action suggest that the sell-off has gone far enough.\\n*****\\n&gt; “Regardless of whether the market is sold out, you can argue tech, especially, is due for a bounce. Both Microsoft and Meta have rallied back to, but not quite through, their respective 50-day averages. These seem key points,” Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Wellington Shields, said in a note to clients on Friday.\\n*****\\n&gt; It is possible that the sell-in-May trend simply started a bit early in 2022.\\n*****\\n&gt; However, there is still some concern that valuations remain too high in parts of the market.\\n*****\\n&gt; “When adjusted for stock compensation, the median tech and communication services companies’ free cash flow yields are below the overall market and most defensive sectors. This suggests that cash flow isn’t at the point at which to support current tech valuation,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday.\\n*****\\n&gt; # Fed meeting ahead\\n&gt; One thing that could break a seasonal trend next week is the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. The central bank is set to release an updated policy statement on Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.\\n*****\\n&gt; The market is pricing in a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, but recent Fed speakers have signaled increasing aggressiveness about the fight against inflation.\\n*****\\n&gt; “The question becomes ‘What will the Fed break?’ If they stick to their verbal outline, their verbal commitment to price stability, how far are they willing to go and what do they see that can break?” asked Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.\\n*****\\n&gt; One term that has come up in recent weeks is “front loading” — the potential for the Fed to do multiple 50-basis point or higher hikes in the months ahead to get close to or even above the supposed neutral policy rate.\\n*****\\n&gt; According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see the Fed funds rate potentially rising to 3% or higher by the end of the year.\\n*****\\n&gt; “They have the luxury at this point of a strong labor market. Why not go in and take it from their toolkit as best they can and try to slow demand as quickly as possible,” Krosby said.\\n*****\\n&gt; After the Fed news on Wednesday, investors will get key labor market data in jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls on Friday.\\n*****\\n&gt; The monthly jobs report for April could get some extra attention this week after a surprise negative gross domestic product reading for the first quarter. Though that decline was driven largely by export and inventory numbers, traders and money managers are watching closely for signs of economic deterioration in the U.S.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KoUAqWt.png))**\\n\\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yWH9bEC.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AgABkLy.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/4Qs4hed.png))**\\n\\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eBSzi8C.png))**\\n\\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XaDAuXQ.png))**\\n\\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TtDsjGX.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tXW1GPN.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRSUWjr.png))**\\n\\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fa9Ol9u.jpg))**\\n\\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1Kc8AJW.png))**\\n\\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/F8hpgvK.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/iO2Tw8z.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # 6 Charts Focused on the Long Term\\n\\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index in correction territory (down more than 10% from the previous peak) while the market faces a number of big threats, including inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve, soaring yields, and war in Eastern Europe, investor anxiety levels are understandably elevated. During volatile markets, it’s difficult to focus on anything beyond the short term, but at times like this studying market history for reminders of the benefits of long-term investing can be helpful for investors\\n\\n&gt; “Individual investors have the benefit of time on their side,” wrote LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “History shows that patience is rewarded during volatile periods in the market. This looks like one of those times.”\\n\\n&gt; Below are 6 charts we think may help investors stay focused on the long term.\\n\\n&gt; First, simply put, stocks have gone up over time as shown in the chart below. Based on this 122-year data series of the Dow Jones Industrials, stocks have gained 9.5% annualized including dividends. That’s a pretty good long-term track record.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.29.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; So what has driven those big gains for stocks all those years? Earnings, plain and simple. While we don’t have 122 years of earnings data for the Dow, we do have 70 years of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share data, shown in the chart below. Earnings have grown at an annualized pace of 7.5% over this time period, consistent with long-term stock price appreciation (excluding dividends).\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.29.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; The next chart shows how punitive it can be to be out of the market on its best days. Though the S&amp;P 500 Index is unmanaged and can’t be owned directly, it’s clear that owning stocks for the long run has been very rewarding and moving in and out and potentially missing out on gains can be costly. Stocks experienced some significant downdrafts during the 31-year period shown in the chart (2000-2002 and 2008-2009 to be specific) and yet the S&amp;P 500 Index still rose an average of 9.9% per year during that time.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.29.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; The next chart shows the probability of S&amp;P 500 Index gains over various rolling time periods since 1950. Based on monthly data, the index was higher in more than 80% of all rolling 3-year and 5-year periods. Going out further, 92% of all 10-year rolling periods saw the S&amp;P 500 move higher, while the S&amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time for all rolling 15-year periods. In other words, those with a greater than a 10-year investing time horizon have an excellent chance to achieve positive returns.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.29.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; It’s also important for investors to remember that when stocks fall, they usually become cheaper relative to earnings. LPL Research certainly believes this is relevant today given the solid earnings trends still in place (despite several high profile disappointments among mega-cap tech and internet stocks this quarter).\\n\\n&gt; The next chart illustrates the relationship between stock valuations—measured by the S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)—and future stock performance. Specifically, the chart shows the future 10-year returns an investor might expect based on the valuation levels at a given point in time. If this relationship holds going forward, then buying stocks at a 19 P/E today positions investors for better long-term returns—perhaps 5-6% annually—than the 24 P/E observed at the start of the year. Note that the P/E scale on the chart’s right axis is inverted, so a rising line reflects lower valuations.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-7.png))**\\n\\n&gt; Earlier this week LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick published a chart (shown here) showing the average maximum peak-to-trough decline in a given year has been 14%. Put another way, as shown in the chart below, on average the S&amp;P 500 has experienced one 10% or greater correction per year. The takeaway here is that the volatility experienced this year, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 13% from January 3 through March 8, is actually quite normal.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-8-4.22.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; So there you have it. Six charts to help put the latest bout of volatility in perspective and remind us of the benefits of long-term investing. Bottom line, be patient, stick to your plan, and if you have a long-term time horizon with a relatively conservative asset allocation, this might not be a bad time to consider adding some equities.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # A Closer Look At The Stock Market Sell Off\\n\\n&gt; The selloff continued on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 7.8% in the usually bullish month of April. With three days to go, this could go down as the worst April since a 9.0% drop in 1970.\\n\\n&gt; The usual suspects of a slowing economy, a hawkish Federal Reserve Bank (Fed), supply chain worries, war in Europe, and now another China shutdown have all combined to make this one of the worst starts to a year ever for both stocks and bonds.\\n\\n&gt; It is important to remember, though, that historically midterm years can be rough, down more than 17% on average peak-to-trough. The March 8 closing low, which amounted to a 13% correction, is still the low for the year as of now. The good news is a year off those lows stocks have historically gained more than 32% on average.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.27.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; One potential worry is in midterm years stocks usually bottom later in the year. “Could stocks bottom for the year in March or April? Sure, but history would say midterm year lows tend to be later in the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “You’d have to chalk this up as one clear potential worry out there still.”\\n\\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, midterm years see the S&amp;P 500 bottom on August 14 on average, and the median bottom is in early September. But the good news that is important for investors to remember is big gains a year off those lows have been quite common.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.27.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; Something else to remember is just how strong the bull market was off the March 2020 lows. As you can see below, this is still the second best start to a bull market ever. After the fastest bull market to double in history, some type of potential weakness or consolidation shouldn’t be overly surprising.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-3-4.27.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; Many investors forget that double-digit declines during a year are actually normal. After only one 5% pullback all of last year, markets have provided an unfriendly reminder in 2022. In fact, since 1980, the average correction each year is 14.0%, putting this year’s 13.0% correction in perspective. Taking this a step further, 21 times since 1980 the S&amp;P 500 has been down double digits at one point from its peak, with an impressive 12 of those years managing to come back and finish the year positive. In fact, the average yearly gain those 12 years was a very solid 17.0%.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.27.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; Lastly, we knew coming into this year that more volatility was possible, potentially early in the year as that’s been the playbook during midterm years. Looking at the entire four-year Presidential cycle shows that this quarter is actually the worst out of 16. Last quarter (year 2, quarter 1) and next quarter (year 2, quarter 3) are pretty weak as well. The good news is some stronger quarters are right around the corner.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.27.22.png))**\\n\\n&gt; The weakness we’ve seen so far this year has been disappointing and taken many investors by surprise. But after more than a 100% rally off the March 2020 lows, some type of usual midterm year frustration was likely. Continue to follow LPL Research, as we help you navigate the investments landscape.\\n\\n***** \\n\\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Down Year-to-Date and Down in April Preceded Year Loss 69.2% of the Time\\n\\n&gt; With just two trading days remaining, April will not likely live up to its historically bullish reputation this year. S&amp;P 500 decline in April as of today is 7.65%, second worst April since 1950 and sixth worst since 1930. As of today’s close, the third from last trading day of April, S&amp;P 500 year-to-date loss of 12.22% is second worse in our data going back to 1930. The worst year was 1970. Since 1950 the combination of a down S&amp;P 500 April combined with a year-to-date loss has been a clearly bearish indicator. Of the previous 13 occasions since 1950, the following May was positive five times with an average loss of 0.39% and the full year finished positive four times. The only full-year double digit gain was way back in 1952. The average loss in all years was 7.26%.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a960d4aba45e10d4add1e5f1957e8858/ed929d404f79a3e0-85/s500x750/8ea7abfbaee3d9beed4cd9ce21f74dcc06761697.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # Welcome To the Weak Spot of the 4-Year Cycle\\n\\n&gt; Unfortunately, the market entered the weak spot of the 4-Year Election Cycle this month with an array of headwinds from the Fed, Inflation, the Ukraine War and now most concerning the China’s unprecedented Covid lockdowns and testing. This situation has the potential to generate the greatest impact on the global economy as it could severely restrict the flow of essential raw materials and goods around the world.\\n\\n&gt; The market is also suffering from the usual disappointments, unmet promises and miscues from the new incumbent administration that has historically restricted market gains through Q2-Q3 of the midterm election – the period we’ve only just begun. As you can see in the chart here Q2-Q3 are the weakest two quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, averaging losses of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949, and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.\\n\\n&gt; The good news is that this weak spot immediately proceeds the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle, which runs from Q4 of the Midterm Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year, averaging gains of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949, and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971.\\n\\n&gt; Caution is definitely in order over the next “Worst Six Months.” We already issued our Seasonal Best Six Months MACD Sell Signal on April 7. But be ready to pounce on the perennial Midterm year bottom that is most likely to hit sometime over the next six months.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ac618f340fa36c112bdb84151fc793ae/560293f794317b34-d1/s500x750/b96af706b2267d1c055b857b82041f64e0a933a8.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; # May is Second Worst S&amp;P 500 Month in Midterm Election Years\\n\\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\\n\\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up thirteen times in the past twenty-four years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down –11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and six losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another sizable loss of 7.9% in 2019.\\n\\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5a8236c820bc5f672ec17dd414c5228/3c57636b132072af-df/s400x600/9b971e3568cbadf1790efcc02c3e7b97aef2c8f0.jpg))**\\n\\n&gt; Since 1950, midterm-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&amp;P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #9 Russell 2000. Performance ranges from a best of +0.1% by Russell 1000 to a worst of –1.1% for Russell 2000. Not one of these indexes has been positive more than 50% of the time in midterm years.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/fa9Ol9u.jpg))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KpCSLec.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPxeaw.jpg))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uHMubat.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp;

According to the Stock Traders Almanac, an investor who held the Dow Jones Industrial Average between Nov. 1 and April 30, and then switched to fixed income for the next six months, would have produced solid returns with reduced risk for more than seven decades now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That seasonal weakness can be especially pronounced in midterm election years, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it has paid to lock in gains ahead of the traditionally challenging May-through-October periods. And this particularly goes for midterm election years, also known as ‘sophomore slumps.’ Indeed, since 1992, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell an average 3.4% in the May-through-October period of midterm election years,” Stovall said in a note to clients Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, jumping to fixed income, as the simple strategy suggests, might not be smartest move.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Cashing out might not be the best option either, since equal exposure to the defensive consumer staples and health care sectors from May through October outpaced the broader benchmark 100% of these years and posted an average six-month total return of 5.6%,” Stovall wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Did May selling come early?&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To be sure, those defensive sectors Stovall highlighted have already been outperforming in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And what about the tech sector, which has been sliding for nearly six months now? Some metrics and market action suggest that the sell-off has gone far enough.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of whether the market is sold out, you can argue tech, especially, is due for a bounce. Both Microsoft and Meta have rallied back to, but not quite through, their respective 50-day averages. These seem key points,” Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Wellington Shields, said in a note to clients on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the sell-in-May trend simply started a bit early in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, there is still some concern that valuations remain too high in parts of the market.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“When adjusted for stock compensation, the median tech and communication services companies’ free cash flow yields are below the overall market and most defensive sectors. This suggests that cash flow isn’t at the point at which to support current tech valuation,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Fed meeting ahead&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that could break a seasonal trend next week is the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. The central bank is set to release an updated policy statement on Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing in a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, but recent Fed speakers have signaled increasing aggressiveness about the fight against inflation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The question becomes ‘What will the Fed break?’ If they stick to their verbal outline, their verbal commitment to price stability, how far are they willing to go and what do they see that can break?” asked Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One term that has come up in recent weeks is “front loading” — the potential for the Fed to do multiple 50-basis point or higher hikes in the months ahead to get close to or even above the supposed neutral policy rate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see the Fed funds rate potentially rising to 3% or higher by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They have the luxury at this point of a strong labor market. Why not go in and take it from their toolkit as best they can and try to slow demand as quickly as possible,” Krosby said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the Fed news on Wednesday, investors will get key labor market data in jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The monthly jobs report for April could get some extra attention this week after a surprise negative gross domestic product reading for the first quarter.

During volatile markets, it’s difficult to focus on anything beyond the short term, but at times like this studying market history for reminders of the benefits of long-term investing can be helpful for investors&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Individual investors have the benefit of time on their side,” wrote LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “History shows that patience is rewarded during volatile periods in the market. This looks like one of those times.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Below are 6 charts we think may help investors stay focused on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First, simply put, stocks have gone up over time as shown in the chart below. Based on this 122-year data series of the Dow Jones Industrials, stocks have gained 9.5% annualized including dividends. That’s a pretty good long-term track record.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.29.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So what has driven those big gains for stocks all those years? Earnings, plain and simple. While we don’t have 122 years of earnings data for the Dow, we do have 70 years of S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings per share data, shown in the chart below. Earnings have grown at an annualized pace of 7.5% over this time period, consistent with long-term stock price appreciation (excluding dividends).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.29.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next chart shows how punitive it can be to be out of the market on its best days. Though the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index is unmanaged and can’t be owned directly, it’s clear that owning stocks for the long run has been very rewarding and moving in and out and potentially missing out on gains can be costly. Stocks experienced some significant downdrafts during the 31-year period shown in the chart (2000-2002 and 2008-2009 to be specific) and yet the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index still rose an average of 9.9% per year during that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.29.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next chart shows the probability of S&amp;amp;P 500 Index gains over various rolling time periods since 1950. Based on monthly data, the index was higher in more than 80% of all rolling 3-year and 5-year periods. Going out further, 92% of all 10-year rolling periods saw the S&amp;amp;P 500 move higher, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time for all rolling 15-year periods. In other words, those with a greater than a 10-year investing time horizon have an excellent chance to achieve positive returns.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.29.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s also important for investors to remember that when stocks fall, they usually become cheaper relative to earnings. LPL Research certainly believes this is relevant today given the solid earnings trends still in place (despite several high profile disappointments among mega-cap tech and internet stocks this quarter).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next chart illustrates the relationship between stock valuations—measured by the S&amp;amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)—and future stock performance. Specifically, the chart shows the future 10-year returns an investor might expect based on the valuation levels at a given point in time. If this relationship holds going forward, then buying stocks at a 19 P/E today positions investors for better long-term returns—perhaps 5-6% annually—than the 24 P/E observed at the start of the year. Note that the P/E scale on the chart’s right axis is inverted, so a rising line reflects lower valuations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-7.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick published a chart (shown here) showing the average maximum peak-to-trough decline in a given year has been 14%. Put another way, as shown in the chart below, on average the S&amp;amp;P 500 has experienced one 10% or greater correction per year. The takeaway here is that the volatility experienced this year, with the S&amp;amp;P 500 falling 13% from January 3 through March 8, is actually quite normal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-8-4.22.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Six charts to help put the latest bout of volatility in perspective and remind us of the benefits of long-term investing. Bottom line, be patient, stick to your plan, and if you have a long-term time horizon with a relatively conservative asset allocation, this might not be a bad time to consider adding some equities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;h1&gt;A Closer Look At The Stock Market Sell Off&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The selloff continued on Tuesday, with the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index down 7.8% in the usually bullish month of April. With three days to go, this could go down as the worst April since a 9.0% drop in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The usual suspects of a slowing economy, a hawkish Federal Reserve Bank (Fed), supply chain worries, war in Europe, and now another China shutdown have all combined to make this one of the worst starts to a year ever for both stocks and bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember, though, that historically midterm years can be rough, down more than 17% on average peak-to-trough. The March 8 closing low, which amounted to a 13% correction, is still the low for the year as of now. The good news is a year off those lows stocks have historically gained more than 32% on average.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.27.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One potential worry is in midterm years stocks usually bottom later in the year. “Could stocks bottom for the year in March or April? Sure, but history would say midterm year lows tend to be later in the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “You’d have to chalk this up as one clear potential worry out there still.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, midterm years see the S&amp;amp;P 500 bottom on August 14 on average, and the median bottom is in early September. But the good news that is important for investors to remember is big gains a year off those lows have been quite common.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.27.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something else to remember is just how strong the bull market was off the March 2020 lows. As you can see below, this is still the second best start to a bull market ever. After the fastest bull market to double in history, some type of potential weakness or consolidation shouldn’t be overly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-3-4.27.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Many investors forget that double-digit declines during a year are actually normal. After only one 5% pullback all of last year, markets have provided an unfriendly reminder in 2022. In fact, since 1980, the average correction each year is 14.0%, putting this year’s 13.0% correction in perspective. Taking this a step further, 21 times since 1980 the S&amp;amp;P 500 has been down double digits at one point from its peak, with an impressive 12 of those years managing to come back and finish the year positive. In fact, the average yearly gain those 12 years was a very solid 17.0%.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.27.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we knew coming into this year that more volatility was possible, potentially early in the year as that’s been the playbook during midterm years. Looking at the entire four-year Presidential cycle shows that this quarter is actually the worst out of 16. Last quarter (year 2, quarter 1) and next quarter (year 2, quarter 3) are pretty weak as well. The good news is some stronger quarters are right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.27.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weakness we’ve seen so far this year has been disappointing and taken many investors by surprise. But after more than a 100% rally off the March 2020 lows, some type of usual midterm year frustration was likely. Continue to follow LPL Research, as we help you navigate the investments landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Down Year-to-Date and Down in April Preceded Year Loss 69.2% of the Time&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With just two trading days remaining, April will not likely live up to its historically bullish reputation this year. S&amp;amp;P 500 decline in April as of today is 7.65%, second worst April since 1950 and sixth worst since 1930. As of today’s close, the third from last trading day of April, S&amp;amp;P 500 year-to-date loss of 12.22% is second worse in our data going back to 1930. The worst year was 1970. Since 1950 the combination of a down S&amp;amp;P 500 April combined with a year-to-date loss has been a clearly bearish indicator. Of the previous 13 occasions since 1950, the following May was positive five times with an average loss of 0.39% and the full year finished positive four times. The only full-year double digit gain was way back in 1952. The average loss in all years was 7.26%.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/a960d4aba45e10d4add1e5f1957e8858/ed929d404f79a3e0-85/s500x750/8ea7abfbaee3d9beed4cd9ce21f74dcc06761697.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;h1&gt;Welcome To the Weak Spot of the 4-Year Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the market entered the weak spot of the 4-Year Election Cycle this month with an array of headwinds from the Fed, Inflation, the Ukraine War and now most concerning the China’s unprecedented Covid lockdowns and testing. This situation has the potential to generate the greatest impact on the global economy as it could severely restrict the flow of essential raw materials and goods around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The market is also suffering from the usual disappointments, unmet promises and miscues from the new incumbent administration that has historically restricted market gains through Q2-Q3 of the midterm election – the period we’ve only just begun. As you can see in the chart here Q2-Q3 are the weakest two quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, averaging losses of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;amp;P 500 since 1949, and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this weak spot immediately proceeds the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle, which runs from Q4 of the Midterm Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year, averaging gains of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;amp;P 500 since 1949, and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caution is definitely in order over the next “Worst Six Months.” We already issued our Seasonal Best Six Months MACD Sell Signal on April 7. But be ready to pounce on the perennial Midterm year bottom that is most likely to hit sometime over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/ac618f340fa36c112bdb84151fc793ae/560293f794317b34-d1/s500x750/b96af706b2267d1c055b857b82041f64e0a933a8.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;h1&gt;May is Second Worst S&amp;amp;P 500 Month in Midterm Election Years&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up thirteen times in the past twenty-four years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down –11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and six losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another sizable loss of 7.9% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5a8236c820bc5f672ec17dd414c5228/3c57636b132072af-df/s400x600/9b971e3568cbadf1790efcc02c3e7b97aef2c8f0.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since 1950, midterm-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&amp;amp;P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #9 Russell 2000.

They are well known for aggressive takeovers, most notably Caesar&amp;#39;s Palace and LyondellBasel. Apollo is known for top level due diligence and is full of smart, aggressive alpha dogs in finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Carvana was having a tough time getting this $3B bond deal done in market. Apollo smelled opportunity and came in with a $1.6B order for the bonds and influenced the bond indenture terms to  suit their interests (they are full of smart lawyers, too). Apollo is best at private equity and they obviously smell opportunity to own Carvana through their unsecured bonds they are buying if there is a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. &lt;a href=\"https://www.maalot.co.il/Publications/TS20210408160139.PDF\"&gt;S&amp;amp;P places a 51% chance of bankruptcy over 8 years on bonds they rate &amp;quot;CCC&amp;quot; or worse&lt;/a&gt; (page 58).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Apollo did this $1.6B bond and will earn 10.25% coupon payments through its 8 year life, which they will gladly take but I think they would prefer owning the equity of Carvana through a bankruptcy restructuring because that is their expertise. There are provisions in this bond that Apollo can utilize for their benefit which could be very bad to CVNA equity holders (you&amp;#39;d be diluted heavily in bankruptcy), so be careful on this one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': True, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': True, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qjfk', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'ufcyo9', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'OhioBaseball', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 6, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/stocks/comments/ufcyo9/carvana_cvna_and_the_significance_of_apollo/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ufcyo9/carvana_cvna_and_the_significance_of_apollo/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 3969938, 'created_utc': 1651331196.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}\n",

Just a collection of some observations that I've had over the past few months.\\n\\n1. The Metaverse already exists\\n\\n Everytime you login to FB/Insta/Twitter/Tiktok/Reddit/multiplayer game - you're logging into the metaverse. That's it, that's the metaverse - a virtual world where humans connect with each other and interact with each other in various ways, play games etc\\n\\n2. Reddit/Twitter hates FB/Meta\\n\\n Everytime someone even attempts to talk about Meta on Reddit/Twitter, there will be a huge list of comments that say how much they hate FB/Zuck, how it's a huge privacy risk etc. Yes, all of that might be true, but ~3B daily active/monthly active users don't seem to care. For 3B people around the world, the value that FB/Meta provides is more than any potential privacy issue. That's more than half of human population(ie excl China) and &gt;70% population with internet access.\\n\\n3. Oculus Quest 2 is a sneak peek into the future\\n\\n You will be surprised to see how positive the reception for OQ2 is even on Reddit and Twitter. OQ2 is currently a near monopoly in the VR market. Just google/search Reddit for OQ2 reviews you will come to the same conclusion.\\n\\n4. Main issues with OQ2 seem temporary\\n\\n The two main issues with OQ2 are the lack of good content and the usability issues like disorientation etc. Both are solvable with tech and time. The tech will improve to make such headsets comfortable for majority of the users. The content library is bad right now mainly because there aren't enough devs and it hasn't been around for long. These problems will be solved.\\n\\n5. Project Cambria leaks look insanely good\\n\\n Project Cambria aka Quest Pro is supposed to release later this year. Just look at the leaks and a picture of Boz(head of Reality Labs at Meta) wearing it. It's got a thin form factor and looks cool and slick exactly like an AAPL product. I can totally see this device becoming the replacement for personal computers and the main way games are played in the future.\\n\\n6. Meta/FB is the only company with an iterative product in VR space\\n\\n Yes AAPL, MSFT, GOOG are all trying but Meta is really the only company with a successful product already out and an app store and an ecosystem in this VR space. I fully expect AAPL to give tough competition to them with a successful device but with the first mover advantage, Meta can easily become the Android of this space.\\n\\n7. VR is a very very important step towards AR, you cannot skip it\\n\\n AR is the ultimate goal. Having an AR glass that's fully integrated with the real world is the ultimate metaverse product. But to get there, you need a lot of tech experimented in the VR and iterate on how to make it work as an overlay on the real world in AR. For example, handling virtual objects, depth perception etc.\\n\\n8. The metaverse will definitely get more immersive\\n\\n Humans love interacting with each other, we love connecting with each other. That's why social media is such a huge thing in our lives, we simply cannot opt out. The natural next step will be a more immersive AR/VR experience to our current metaverse of social media apps. People love to claim that they like the real world but the huge success of FB/Insta/Youtube/Tiktok suggest otherwise. (Imagine watching a live basketball game courtside seats with a friend who lives 1000 miles away)\\n\\n9. Dismissing the potential of the metaverse is akin to dismissing the potential of the internet/personal computers in the 90s\\n\\n Every single time there was a new piece of technology that was introduced, there have been naysayers. People really thought bicycles were a bad thing once (check Pessimists archive on Twitter). Given the above observations, a more immersive metaverse is inevitable, it's just a matter of time.\\n\\n10. FB/Meta is probably the best company positioned for the metaverse right now\\n\\n Meta is really again the only company with a VR product out and the amount of learning they can do with this data will be very valuable for their AR venture. It might take more than 10 years to get to a fully functioning metaverse but their hardware division will not be at a loss for long, just because of the prospects in gaming alone. VR gaming will be the only way to game in the near future and Meta will be the biggest ecosystem there. They will take the profits from this ecosystem and improve their metaverse offerings.\\n\\nAbove all this, they are already a very profitable growing company with a huge cash flow from their Family of Apps, valued very very cheaply at the moment. \\n\\nI will setup 5 and 10-year reminders in the comments, I will either look like a genius or a fool.

How bad does this guy suck? That's what I wanted to find out.\\n\\n**Disclosure**\\n\\nI'm actually running this strategy lmao - [check it](http://github.com/sommohapatra/inverse-cramer-index) (GitHub)\\n\\n**The Strategy**\\n\\nA long-only portfolio mimicking an “Inverse Cramer” strategy through positions in stocks described as “sells” on Jim Cramer’s Mad Money. Lightning round picks omitted, rebalanced monthly. Risk-adjusted pre-rebalance through volatility + Sharpe-hedging, as well as anti-momentum hedging based on previous monthly returns.\\n\\n**The Data**\\n\\nThe data is pulled from [The Street](https://www.thestreet.com/), a financial news and literacy site, by [Quantbase](http://getquantbase.com/), a retail quant hedge fund. 23,000 rows of data following every Mad Money episode, every call on every segment on the show. Segments divided into Lightning Round, Game Plan, Sell Block, Am I Diversified?, Mad Mail, and 10 others. Calls ranked from 1 to 5 (inclusive) — 1 being a highly negative, 5 being a highly positive, with less than 1% at neutral (3). This was all sourced on a pretty untransferable HTML. Tried a bunch of things, like copy-pasting to Excel, downloading the source, etc. What ended up working was saving the webpage to a 644-page PDF, copying the data to an HTML stripping site, then pasting it to Excel finally.\\n\\nData cleanup consisted of sorting the data by ticker, date, segment of the show (Lightning Round, etc), [Cramer’s call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money) (my primary source of alpha) whether positive or negative, historical and current prices, as well as by rebalance period. After that, I cleaned out names that were no longer investable at the point of investment in the backtest — aka if a rebalance was to occur in December 31, 2016 of stocks between October and December that year, and a stock mentioned by Cramer in October was no longer tradable in December, it had to go. Decided not to do any statistical or call/period-based cleaning until later on in the process (as this entire process was iterative) As we're looking at an aggregation of data from a set past period to then make the picks that we’ll hold onto for the next period, a backtest looks at each rebalance period as if the only information it knows is the information presented up until that date. Effectively, it means that we can’t use 2021 data to “predict” stock prices in 2016. [Duh, right?!](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/030205.asp)\\n\\n**The Testing**\\n\\n[Backtesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp), again, is iterative. I started off with a set of data, and come up with strategies that do well with that data in backtests, and then hoped that this process holds over the following periods. A good investment strategy works until it doesn’t, meaning you have to tweak it again to create any sort of alpha. I expect to have a team tweaking this index from time to time for that reason.\\n\\nTo set a baseline, I did a “naive” test that doesn’t actually make any kind of strategic (allocation) or tactical (timing) decision-making happen. Cramer does about 150–200 “1” picks (aka “sell immediately”) every quarter. We picked a random 10 per quarter, for all 24 quarters that data existed for, then did the backtest on it. We ran this naive testing algorithm 500 times — here are the average results:\\n\\n* Correlation with the S&amp;P — 66.69%\\n* Daily Volatility — 1.32%\\n* Sharpe Ratio — 0.18\\n* Max Drawdown — 53.73%\\n* Annual Return since 2016 — 1.27%\\n\\nOuch! Clearly, just naively picking Cramer’s inverse stocks doesn’t work. We need to be more clever here. Let me know if you're looking for deeper discussions of each of these stats - I can make a follow-on post or something. For this one, we focus on the Sharpe and the Annual Return. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated by taking the mean return of a portfolio over a period and dividing by the standard deviation of the portfolio, then adjusted based on the frequency of the return data. A Sharpe above 1 is [considered great](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for a portfolio (“I’m getting a return without having to take on a similar amount of risk”). A Sharpe between 0 and 1 is considered not so great. Below 0 means the portfolio is just losing money, and you’d be better off investing in bonds.\\n\\nI also ran the naive algorithm multiple times with Cramer’s “2” calls. \\\\*\\\\* Cramer’s 2’s: \\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n* Correlation with the S&amp;P — 71.12%\\n* Daily Volatility — 1.39%\\n* Sharpe Ratio — 0.42\\n* Max Drawdown — 46.04%\\n* Annual Return since 2016 — 8.00%\\n\\nThis is…a little funny. Maybe Cramer does have some predictive power? Stocks he likes a bit better than absolute hatred, have a 3x Sharpe ratio, and the returns are starting to speak for themselves.\\n\\nThe S&amp;P, by comparison, has had a stellar last decade, abut 15% annualized return. An inverse Cramer isn’t a panacea, unfortunately, for market-beating returns.\\n\\nI tried a few other iterations. Naive but full test (investing in an allocation of all his picks, not just a random sample), weighting by volume, by market cap, by sentiment at date of rebalance, by sentiment at the date of the call, what it looked like without taking into account his rapid Lightning Round picks (accounting for 40% of all his calls), with different sets of his calls (maybe some 4s and 5s in there to hedge against the inverse-ness, but that’s no fun) and with different rebalance periods.\\n\\nWhat I ended up with was a portfolio that rebalanced monthly, with just Cramer’s “2” picks, without any of Cramer’s Lightning Round picks. Test results below:\\n\\n* Correlation with the S&amp;P — 81.31%\\n* Daily Volatility — 1.05%\\n* Sharpe Ratio — 0.51\\n* Max Drawdown — 39.84%\\n* Annual Return since 2016 — 8.54%\\n\\nA Sharpe of 0.51 still leaves room for improvement — we’re not done yet. I did some portfolio optimization for weighting, then looked to decrease my risk by getting rid of the top n worst performers (in terms of highest volatility) pre-rebalance of the previous rebalance period. The n I arrived at was around 90 (thus making a much more concentrated portfolio than earlier). Final tests:\\n\\n* Correlation with the S&amp;P — 77.13%\\n* Daily Volatility — 1.15%\\n* Sharpe Ratio — 0.61\\n* Max Drawdown — 40.21%\\n* Annual Return since 2016 — 10.94%\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe last quarter has been negative, for the market as a whole but also for [Cramer haters](https://twitter.com/quantbase_/status/1491152855918837764?s=20&amp;t=m81L8mXL7y2pukUNKgAAMQ) who look at all of his picks systematically (and not just the ones that get the most attention, like Coinbase, Robinhood, etc etc). If you take rolling returns, then without taking into account the last year (upswings in early 2021 included with the downturn of the last quarter), you get a better Sharpe of 0.89. Still not above 1.0, though, meaning the portfolio isn’t as optimal as it could be, on a traditional risk-adjusted basis. But that’s something that can be said for all portfolios at some point in their horizon, even the benchmark. SPY didn’t hit above a 0.63 rolling 12-month Sharpe for almost the entirety of 2018 and 2019. Some food for thought.

The giant investment firm agreed to purchase about half of $3.275 billion of bonds Carvana is issuing to purchase car-auction network ADESA U.S., people familiar with the matter said. Carvana had a hard time attracting investors following a disappointing first-quarter earnings report and stock selloff. Apollo’s intervention highlights the growing clout of private debt and equity firms that are bankrolling swaths of the U.S. economy. Shares of Carvana surged during the pandemic but tumbled over the past eight months as secondhand car prices declined and investors grew concerned about the company’s continued losses. ADESA was meant to accelerate growth, and Carvana hired JPMorgan Chase to raise billions of dollars in debt and equity to pay for the purchase and subsequent integration.\\n\\nThe financing ran into headwinds last week when the company reported a more-than sixfold increase in net losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier. The company was one of the biggest losers in the tech stock selloff, which was driven by rising interest rates and worries about a recession. Carvana blamed a mix of tough economic conditions—rising interest rates, higher gas prices, inflation-weary consumers—for its first-ever decline in quarterly retail sales. It also acknowledged to investors that the constant pressure to continue its rapid expansion has played an outsize role in its priorities, and it pledged to reduce costs and improve its efficiency. The deal with Apollo is an acknowledgment that filling the hole in its balance sheet had taken precedence over growth. The onerous interest rate on the debt could make it difficult for the company to invest in growth. Carvana has burned cash since its founding 10 years ago.\\n\\nCarvana shares dropped about 30% in recent weeks and bond prices also fell, pushing up the yield that bond investors demanded to lend the company more money. Bond yields rise when prices fall. Carvana disclosed plans Monday to issue $2.275 billion of bonds and $1 billion of preferred shares for the ADESA acquisition. Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III and his father, Ernie Garcia II, participated in a roughly $1.2 billion new common-stock issue to boost cash levels. Apollo privately committed to buy $600 million of the preferred shares, but JPMorgan struggled to find enough buyers for the bonds, fund managers who considered the deal said. By Tuesday, the clearing yield for the bond deal was above 10.5%, a level that might have forced JPMorgan to forgo some or all of its fees for the financing, the fund managers said. Apollo, which has invested in Carvana stock and debt for years, proposed an alternative: Carvana would scrap the preferred stock sale and issue $3.3 billion of 10.25% bonds backstopped by a $1.6 billion order from Apollo. That yield is well above the average for most junk bonds.\\n\\nThe revised deal came with a twist, in which Carvana would be barred from prepaying the new debt for about five years—roughly twice the normal period for junk bonds. Apollo stands to make about 1.6 times its money if the bonds are subsequently repaid. It would have made about 1.3 times its money on the preferred shares, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Such large checks have grown increasingly common as private fund managers raised unprecedented sums of money, prompting them to hunt for increasingly big trade ideas. The funds provided jumbo rescue loans to companies like Airbnb Inc. and Carnival Corp. during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nApollo manages about half a trillion dollars and made a similar $1.5 billion preferred-stock investment in Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in 2021 to help lift the car-rental company out of bankruptcy. The Hertz deal paid out handsomely, but Carvana’s future is uncertain for now. Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating of Carvana this week to triple-C, one of the lowest rungs on the junk-debt ratings ladder, citing persistent lack of profitability, negative cash flow and corporate-governance risk. Credit ratings firm S&amp;P Global said Wednesday that the replacement of the preferred equity with debt will result in higher interest costs that will put pressure on the company’s cash flow. S&amp;P estimated that the additional capital would help the company cover about two years of cash burn. “Technology companies can offer excess yield, but investors need to pay attention to the quality and stability of cash flows,” said Scott Giardina, managing director at FS Investments. “Technology business models are generally asset light, and bankruptcy recoveries will tend to be lower than more traditional asset-based companies.” Carvana, which went public in 2017, has burned through cash and relied heavily on debt investors to fund its operations, similar to tech companies such as Netflix Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.\", 'author_fullname': 't2_4e0be210', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Carvana, once a Stock Market darling, forced to turn to a Apollo for cash highlighting growing clout of equity firms bankrolling US economy', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/stocks', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_ueyqcc', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.94, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 45, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 45, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1651275973.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.stocks', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apollo-to-purchase-1-6-billion-of-carvana-bonds-11651084271\"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/apollo-to-purchase-1-6-billion-of-carvana-bonds-11651084271&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Carvana&amp;#39;s financial troubles spilled over into debt markets this week when the online used-car dealer struggled to sell bonds and was forced to turn to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $1.6 billion to salvage the deal.

            "{'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'stocks', 'selftext': '(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. will together give more cash to shareholders than they invest in oil and gas production this year even as political leaders call on the industry to increase output to help ease soaring consumer prices. \\n\\nThe U.S. supermajors will shower investors with a combined $50.3 billion in stock buybacks and dividends this year, compared with $37.5 billion in total capital expenditures, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That gap is the highest since Big Oil’s heyday in 2008. In fact, for 11 of the past 15 years, Exxon and Chevron have actually done the opposite: Their combined capital expenditures have exceeded shareholder returns.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden has implored oil companies to reinvest profits from surging oil prices into more production in an effort to curb rampant inflation and ease the energy shortages caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine. Some U.S. Democrats as well as European leaders have gone further, accusing Big Oil of “profiteering” from high energy prices and calling for a windfall tax on earnings. \\n\\n“Consumers should not get punched in the face so that Big Oil can stuff its overflowing coffers,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy group.\\n\\nChevron is “very sensitive” to the needs of consumers, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said on a Friday call with analysts. The oil giant is increasing production in the Permian Basin by at least 15% this year and has become much more efficient in recent years, meaning it can produce more oil with less capital spending than in the past.

That gap is the highest since Big Oil’s heyday in 2008. In fact, for 11 of the past 15 years, Exxon and Chevron have actually done the opposite: Their combined capital expenditures have exceeded shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Joe Biden has implored oil companies to reinvest profits from surging oil prices into more production in an effort to curb rampant inflation and ease the energy shortages caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine. Some U.S. Democrats as well as European leaders have gone further, accusing Big Oil of “profiteering” from high energy prices and calling for a windfall tax on earnings. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Consumers should not get punched in the face so that Big Oil can stuff its overflowing coffers,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chevron is “very sensitive” to the needs of consumers, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said on a Friday call with analysts. The oil giant is increasing production in the Permian Basin by at least 15% this year and has become much more efficient in recent years, meaning it can produce more oil with less capital spending than in the past. Chevron’s global production will be roughly flat this year but remains near a record high.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re growing energy supply in the U.S.,” Breber said. “At the same time, the objective for a capital-intensive commodity business is to do it in the most capital-efficient way.

            "{'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'stocks', 'selftext': \"Stocks have fallen but they have a lot to fall more unless serious measures will be taken by US and EU Governments and I'm not seeing them doing that. Here is my opinion.\\n\\nThis is mostly a supply led inflation, it's very different than other inflation cycles we witnessed in the past because those were demand based and could be addressed by raising interest rates to curb pressure on demand. Stocks would still go up with interest rates rising because the economy was booming.\\n\\nThis inflation cycle is different and only have a precedent during the early '70 oil supply crisis that caused stagflation and a massive stock market crash. How bad was that crash? Well, in the US the market lost 50% of its value, in the UK the stock market lost well over 70% of its value. As can you imagine, we are just at the beginning of the crash and in my opinion the situation today is worse than in the '70 so the stock market crash can be worse.\\n\\nThe point is, we are seeing inflation because commodities prices are rising and those higher prices of production are then transferred to the consumers. How do you fix it? Well, you can only fix it by increasing supply of those commodities. What are we doing instead? We are boycotting all supplies from one of the biggest producer in the world: Russia. And ESG policies are also targeting local companies  so their CAPEX is very low. And you can't just increase CAPEX overnight, it takes years. Add to that that the current US Administration has very bad relations (the worst since many decades) with Saudi Arabia and UAE, two of the biggest oil producers in the world. They already said they won't increase oil production.\\n\\nWhat the FED can do? Well, not much in reality because the FED is very useful to fix demand led inflation cycles but they can't do much to fix supply led inflation because they don't set commodity prices. It's all about demand and supply and since the supply is low the only thing the FED can do is destroy demand to match the low supply and reach a new equilibrium. But you see where we are going? To lower inflation to 2% the FED will have to destroy demand so much to cause a big recession. Any soft landing talk is bullshit. There can't be any soft landing given the circumstances. The FED will have to raise rates so much because the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates rising (in a supply led crisis) is much lower than in a demand-led crisis. And by raising that much a recession will follow and the demand destruction will match the supply, finally lowering inflation. The stock market will crash massively with a big recession.\\n\\nThis is already very bad, but things get even worse when we consider Europe. They are very dependent on Russian commodities and if they ban russian oil and gas, the price of these commodities will skyrocket to over 150$/barrel. Now, Europe already is experiencing a massive inflationary cycle (same as the US, supply led) but contrary to the US they can't raise interest rates much because the very existence of the euro currency is at stake. Why? Well, because Southern European countries already have such a massive debt (and zero growth) that they wouldn't be able to finance themselves in an open market at rates low enough to keep their economies afloat and not default on their debt. Indeed after the Sovereign debt cycle the ECB one way or another bought massive amount of their debt to keep them from defaulting but that was a band-aid that only postponed their demise.\\n\\nNow, there is a Covid-related vast debt buying program that the ECB is doing but it's gonna end soon. Keep in mind the ECB, by charter, can't buy debt of Sovereign countries because it's totally independent and this is why a massive crisis will happen in Europe. I try to explain. Until now the ECB kept these countries from failing with different emergency buying programs and there were never inflationary pressures so interest rates were held below zero. Now inflation is above 8%, the ECB (contrary to the FED) has only one goal: to keep the inflation around 2%. So they have to raise interest rates and can't keep find excuses to buy Sovereign debt and expand their massive balance sheet because otherwise inflation will keep go higher and they would not respect their charter (by law they can't do it).\\n\\nAs soon as the ECB stop this debt buying program (they say it's gonna end soon) and raise rates, Southern European countries will experience big problems in financing their debt in the open market. Debt spreads between EU countries will rise and a new big Sovereign debt crisis (much bigger than the one in 2011/2012) will emerge threatening the survivability of the euro itself because Europe would need two different monetary policies (a lax one in the South, and a hawkish one in the North) but they only have one central bank.\\n\\nImagine a scenario with stagflation (high inflation+recession) and Sovereign debt crisis at the same time. This duo will create probably the biggest crisis in European stock market in history. Once they crash, the repercussions will be felt in the US as well because the economy is interconnected....imagine all US companies (already with the US crash I explained above) having to deal with demand destruction from a massive crisis in Europe...the recession in the US would get so much worse.\\n\\nSo, how do we get out of this crisis? I don't think there is a way unless the commodity inflation is taken care of and looking at the comments from various US and European politicians I don't see this scenario to happen...actually it's the opposite since they want to ban ever more russian commodities creating the condition for the scenario I explained above. The thing is, in the current interconnected world, already experiencing commodities price pressure, you can't ban the commodities from Russia (after you already did it with Iran and Venezuela) without ruining our economies too. By trying to ruin Russian economy, we'll ruin our economy and crash the stock market. Unfortunately, not many people have understood it and there is so much ignorance in this regard...so many people think they can ban those commodities and feel no effect in their countries. Economic ignorance and emotional based decisions are the biggest threat to our economies.\\n\\nWhy I'm extremely bearish on the stock market? Because the politicians went so far with their words that now can't walk their comments and decisions back. Every person that try to explain that boycotting russian commodities will cause a massive recession and stagflation in Europe and US is thought of as a Putin friend. The average person is just as dumb as a rock and no matter how you try to explain it, they don't get it.\\n\\nHow to position in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment? Well, I think going long commodities stocks, shorting the Nasdaq (with many stocks that reached very high valuations after the Covid crisis) and shorting Europeans stock indexes would provide decent results in the next year. As I said I really believe the stock market will crash more than during the '70 and back then it crashed over 50% in the US and over 70% in Europe.\", 'author_fullname': 't2_2qp6icqm', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': \"Why I'm bearish on the market right now\", 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/stocks', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'advice', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_ufb746', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'upvote_ratio': 0.51, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 3, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Advice', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 3, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': 1651326222.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1651325664.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.stocks', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks have fallen but they have a lot to fall more unless serious measures will be taken by US and EU Governments and I&amp;#39;m not seeing them doing that.

They are very dependent on Russian commodities and if they ban russian oil and gas, the price of these commodities will skyrocket to over 150$/barrel. Now, Europe already is experiencing a massive inflationary cycle (same as the US, supply led) but contrary to the US they can&amp;#39;t raise interest rates much because the very existence of the euro currency is at stake. Why? Well, because Southern European countries already have such a massive debt (and zero growth) that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to finance themselves in an open market at rates low enough to keep their economies afloat and not default on their debt. Indeed after the Sovereign debt cycle the ECB one way or another bought massive amount of their debt to keep them from defaulting but that was a band-aid that only postponed their demise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there is a Covid-related vast debt buying program that the ECB is doing but it&amp;#39;s gonna end soon. Keep in mind the ECB, by charter, can&amp;#39;t buy debt of Sovereign countries because it&amp;#39;s totally independent and this is why a massive crisis will happen in Europe. I try to explain. Until now the ECB kept these countries from failing with different emergency buying programs and there were never inflationary pressures so interest rates were held below zero. Now inflation is above 8%, the ECB (contrary to the FED) has only one goal: to keep the inflation around 2%. So they have to raise interest rates and can&amp;#39;t keep find excuses to buy Sovereign debt and expand their massive balance sheet because otherwise inflation will keep go higher and they would not respect their charter (by law they can&amp;#39;t do it).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as the ECB stop this debt buying program (they say it&amp;#39;s gonna end soon) and raise rates, Southern European countries will experience big problems in financing their debt in the open market. Debt spreads between EU countries will rise and a new big Sovereign debt crisis (much bigger than the one in 2011/2012) will emerge threatening the survivability of the euro itself because Europe would need two different monetary policies (a lax one in the South, and a hawkish one in the North) but they only have one central bank.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario with stagflation (high inflation+recession) and Sovereign debt crisis at the same time. This duo will create probably the biggest crisis in European stock market in history. Once they crash, the repercussions will be felt in the US as well because the economy is interconnected....imagine all US companies (already with the US crash I explained above) having to deal with demand destruction from a massive crisis in Europe...the recession in the US would get so much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, how do we get out of this crisis? I don&amp;#39;t think there is a way unless the commodity inflation is taken care of and looking at the comments from various US and European politicians I don&amp;#39;t see this scenario to happen...actually it&amp;#39;s the opposite since they want to ban ever more russian commodities creating the condition for the scenario I explained above. The thing is, in the current interconnected world, already experiencing commodities price pressure, you can&amp;#39;t ban the commodities from Russia (after you already did it with Iran and Venezuela) without ruining our economies too. By trying to ruin Russian economy, we&amp;#39;ll ruin our economy and crash the stock market. Unfortunately, not many people have understood it and there is so much ignorance in this regard...so many people think they can ban those commodities and feel no effect in their countries. Economic ignorance and emotional based decisions are the biggest threat to our economies.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;#39;m extremely bearish on the stock market? Because the politicians went so far with their words that now can&amp;#39;t walk their comments and decisions back. Every person that try to explain that boycotting russian commodities will cause a massive recession and stagflation in Europe and US is thought of as a Putin friend. The average person is just as dumb as a rock and no matter how you try to explain it, they don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How to position in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment? Well, I think going long commodities stocks, shorting the Nasdaq (with many stocks that reached very high valuations after the Covid crisis) and shorting Europeans stock indexes would provide decent results in the next year. As I said I really believe the stock market will crash more than during the &amp;#39;70 and back then it crashed over 50% in the US and over 70% in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': True, 'is_crosspostable': True, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01', 'can_gild': True, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qjfk', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#646d73', 'id': 'ufb746', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Most_Champion', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 91, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/stocks/comments/ufb746/why_im_bearish_on_the_market_right_now/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ufb746/why_im_bearish_on_the_market_right_now/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 3969938, 'created_utc': 1651325664.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index in correction territory (down more than 10% from the previous peak) while the market faces a number of big threats, including inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve, soaring yields, and war in Eastern Europe, investor anxiety levels are understandably elevated. During volatile markets, it’s difficult to focus on anything beyond the short term, but at times like this studying market history for reminders of the benefits of long-term investing can be helpful for investors\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; “Individual investors have the benefit of time on their side,” wrote LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “History shows that patience is rewarded during volatile periods in the market. This looks like one of those times.”\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; Below are 6 charts we think may help investors stay focused on the long term.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; First, simply put, stocks have gone up over time as shown in the chart below. Based on this 122-year data series of the Dow Jones Industrials, stocks have gained 9.5% annualized including dividends. That’s a pretty good long-term track record.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.29.22.png))**\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; So what has driven those big gains for stocks all those years? Earnings, plain and simple. While we don’t have 122 years of earnings data for the Dow, we do have 70 years of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share data, shown in the chart below. Earnings have grown at an annualized pace of 7.5% over this time period, consistent with long-term stock price appreciation (excluding dividends).\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; The next chart shows how punitive it can be to be out of the market on its best days. Though the S&amp;P 500 Index is unmanaged and can’t be owned directly, it’s clear that owning stocks for the long run has been very rewarding and moving in and out and potentially missing out on gains can be costly. Stocks experienced some significant downdrafts during the 31-year period shown in the chart (2000-2002 and 2008-2009 to be specific) and yet the S&amp;P 500 Index still rose an average of 9.9% per year during that time.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; The next chart shows the probability of S&amp;P 500 Index gains over various rolling time periods since 1950. Based on monthly data, the index was higher in more than 80% of all rolling 3-year and 5-year periods. Going out further, 92% of all 10-year rolling periods saw the S&amp;P 500 move higher, while the S&amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time for all rolling 15-year periods. In other words, those with a greater than a 10-year investing time horizon have an excellent chance to achieve positive returns.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; It’s also important for investors to remember that when stocks fall, they usually become cheaper relative to earnings. LPL Research certainly believes this is relevant today given the solid earnings trends still in place (despite several high profile disappointments among mega-cap tech and internet stocks this quarter).\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; The next chart illustrates the relationship between stock valuations—measured by the S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)—and future stock performance. Specifically, the chart shows the future 10-year returns an investor might expect based on the valuation levels at a given point in time. If this relationship holds going forward, then buying stocks at a 19 P/E today positions investors for better long-term returns—perhaps 5-6% annually—than the 24 P/E observed at the start of the year. Note that the P/E scale on the chart’s right axis is inverted, so a rising line reflects lower valuations.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; Earlier this week LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick published a chart (shown here) showing the average maximum peak-to-trough decline in a given year has been 14%. Put another way, as shown in the chart below, on average the S&amp;P 500 has experienced one 10% or greater correction per year. The takeaway here is that the volatility experienced this year, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 13% from January 3 through March 8, is actually quite normal.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; The selloff continued on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 7.8% in the usually bullish month of April. With three days to go, this could go down as the worst April since a 9.0% drop in 1970.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; The usual suspects of a slowing economy, a hawkish Federal Reserve Bank (Fed), supply chain worries, war in Europe, and now another China shutdown have all combined to make this one of the worst starts to a year ever for both stocks and bonds.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; It is important to remember, though, that historically midterm years can be rough, down more than 17% on average peak-to-trough. The March 8 closing low, which amounted to a 13% correction, is still the low for the year as of now. The good news is a year off those lows stocks have historically gained more than 32% on average.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; One potential worry is in midterm years stocks usually bottom later in the year. “Could stocks bottom for the year in March or April? Sure, but history would say midterm year lows tend to be later in the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “You’d have to chalk this up as one clear potential worry out there still.”\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, midterm years see the S&amp;P 500 bottom on August 14 on average, and the median bottom is in early September. But the good news that is important for investors to remember is big gains a year off those lows have been quite common.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; Something else to remember is just how strong the bull market was off the March 2020 lows. As you can see below, this is still the second best start to a bull market ever. After the fastest bull market to double in history, some type of potential weakness or consolidation shouldn’t be overly surprising.\n",

            "&gt; Many investors forget that double-digit declines during a year are actually normal. After only one 5% pullback all of last year, markets have provided an unfriendly reminder in 2022. In fact, since 1980, the average correction each year is 14.0%, putting this year’s 13.0% correction in perspective. Taking this a step further, 21 times since 1980 the S&amp;P 500 has been down double digits at one point from its peak, with an impressive 12 of those years managing to come back and finish the year positive. In fact, the average yearly gain those 12 years was a very solid 17.0%.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt; Lastly, we knew coming into this year that more volatility was possible, potentially early in the year as that’s been the playbook during midterm years. Looking at the entire four-year Presidential cycle shows that this quarter is actually the worst out of 16. Last quarter (year 2, quarter 1) and next quarter (year 2, quarter 3) are pretty weak as well. The good news is some stronger quarters are right around the corner.\n",

Carvana is rated Caa2/CCC+ by Moody's and S&amp;P -- that is deep junk. They only rate bonds that low if they question the \"sustainability\" of their debt. They are raising $3B of unsecured bonds to pay for the acquisition of Adesa, a used car auction business. They are having to pay 10.25% for these bonds, which is really expensive money.

Decided not to do any statistical or call/period-based cleaning until later on in the process (as this entire process was iterative) As we're looking at an aggregation of data from a set past period to then make the picks that we’ll hold onto for the next period, a backtest looks at each rebalance period as if the only information it knows is the information presented up until that date.

If you take rolling returns, then without taking into account the last year (upswings in early 2021 included with the downturn of the last quarter), you get a better Sharpe of 0.89. Still not above 1.0, though, meaning the portfolio isn’t as optimal as it could be, on a traditional risk-adjusted basis. But that’s something that can be said for all portfolios at some point in their horizon, even the benchmark. SPY didn’t hit above a 0.63 rolling 12-month Sharpe for almost the entirety of 2018 and 2019. Some food for thought. It's live, but the index is still undergoing testing to get even better.\n",

            "\n",
            "Carvana's financial troubles spilled over into debt markets this week when the online used-car dealer struggled to sell bonds and was forced to turn to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $1.6 billion to salvage the deal. The giant investment firm agreed to purchase about half of $3.275 billion of bonds Carvana is issuing to purchase car-auction network ADESA U.S., people familiar with the matter said. Carvana had a hard time attracting investors following a disappointing first-quarter earnings report and stock selloff. Apollo’s intervention highlights the growing clout of private debt and equity firms that are bankrolling swaths of the U.S. economy. Shares of Carvana surged during the pandemic but tumbled over the past eight months as secondhand car prices declined and investors grew concerned about the company’s continued losses. ADESA was meant to accelerate growth, and Carvana hired JPMorgan Chase to raise billions of dollars in debt and equity to pay for the purchase and subsequent integration.\n",
            "\n",
            "The financing ran into headwinds last week when the company reported a more-than sixfold increase in net losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier. The company was one of the biggest losers in the tech stock selloff, which was driven by rising interest rates and worries about a recession. Carvana blamed a mix of tough economic conditions—rising interest rates, higher gas prices, inflation-weary consumers—for its first-ever decline in quarterly retail sales. It also acknowledged to investors that the constant pressure to continue its rapid expansion has played an outsize role in its priorities, and it pledged to reduce costs and improve its efficiency. The deal with Apollo is an acknowledgment that filling the hole in its balance sheet had taken precedence over growth. The onerous interest rate on the debt could make it difficult for the company to invest in growth. Carvana has burned cash since its founding 10 years ago.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carvana shares dropped about 30% in recent weeks and bond prices also fell, pushing up the yield that bond investors demanded to lend the company more money. Bond yields rise when prices fall. Carvana disclosed plans Monday to issue $2.275 billion of bonds and $1 billion of preferred shares for the ADESA acquisition. Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III and his father, Ernie Garcia II, participated in a roughly $1.2 billion new common-stock issue to boost cash levels. Apollo privately committed to buy $600 million of the preferred shares, but JPMorgan struggled to find enough buyers for the bonds, fund managers who considered the deal said. By Tuesday, the clearing yield for the bond deal was above 10.5%, a level that might have forced JPMorgan to forgo some or all of its fees for the financing, the fund managers said. Apollo, which has invested in Carvana stock and debt for years, proposed an alternative: Carvana would scrap the preferred stock sale and issue $3.3 billion of 10.25% bonds backstopped by a $1.6 billion order from Apollo. That yield is well above the average for most junk bonds.\n",
            "\n",
            "The revised deal came with a twist, in which Carvana would be barred from prepaying the new debt for about five years—roughly twice the normal period for junk bonds. Apollo stands to make about 1.6 times its money if the bonds are subsequently repaid. It would have made about 1.3 times its money on the preferred shares, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Such large checks have grown increasingly common as private fund managers raised unprecedented sums of money, prompting them to hunt for increasingly big trade ideas. The funds provided jumbo rescue loans to companies like Airbnb Inc. and Carnival Corp. during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "\n",
            "Apollo manages about half a trillion dollars and made a similar $1.5 billion preferred-stock investment in Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in 2021 to help lift the car-rental company out of bankruptcy. The Hertz deal paid out handsomely, but Carvana’s future is uncertain for now. Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating of Carvana this week to triple-C, one of the lowest rungs on the junk-debt ratings ladder, citing persistent lack of profitability, negative cash flow and corporate-governance risk. Credit ratings firm S&amp;P Global said Wednesday that the replacement of the preferred equity with debt will result in higher interest costs that will put pressure on the company’s cash flow. S&amp;P estimated that the additional capital would help the company cover about two years of cash burn. “Technology companies can offer excess yield, but investors need to pay attention to the quality and stability of cash flows,” said Scott Giardina, managing director at FS Investments. “Technology business models are generally asset light, and bankruptcy recoveries will tend to be lower than more traditional asset-based companies.” Carvana, which went public in 2017, has burned through cash and relied heavily on debt investors to fund its operations, similar to tech companies such as Netflix Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.\n",

            "This is mostly a supply led inflation, it's very different than other inflation cycles we witnessed in the past because those were demand based and could be addressed by raising interest rates to curb pressure on demand.

Well, in the US the market lost 50% of its value, in the UK the stock market lost well over 70% of its value. As can you imagine, we are just at the beginning of the crash and in my opinion the situation today is worse than in the '70 so the stock market crash can be worse.\n",
            "\n",
            "The point is, we are seeing inflation because commodities prices are rising and those higher prices of production are then transferred to the consumers. How do you fix it? Well, you can only fix it by increasing supply of those commodities. What are we doing instead? We are boycotting all supplies from one of the biggest producer in the world: Russia. And ESG policies are also targeting local companies  so their CAPEX is very low. And you can't just increase CAPEX overnight, it takes years. Add to that that the current US Administration has very bad relations (the worst since many decades) with Saudi Arabia and UAE, two of the biggest oil producers in the world. They already said they won't increase oil production.\n",

            "What the FED can do? Well, not much in reality because the FED is very useful to fix demand led inflation cycles but they can't do much to fix supply led inflation because they don't set commodity prices. It's all about demand and supply and since the supply is low the only thing the FED can do is destroy demand to match the low supply and reach a new equilibrium. But you see where we are going? To lower inflation to 2% the FED will have to destroy demand so much to cause a big recession. Any soft landing talk is bullshit. There can't be any soft landing given the circumstances. The FED will have to raise rates so much because the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates rising (in a supply led crisis) is much lower than in a demand-led crisis. And by raising that much a recession will follow and the demand destruction will match the supply, finally lowering inflation. The stock market will crash massively with a big recession.\n",

They are very dependent on Russian commodities and if they ban russian oil and gas, the price of these commodities will skyrocket to over 150$/barrel. Now, Europe already is experiencing a massive inflationary cycle (same as the US, supply led) but contrary to the US they can't raise interest rates much because the very existence of the euro currency is at stake. Why? Well, because Southern European countries already have such a massive debt (and zero growth) that they wouldn't be able to finance themselves in an open market at rates low enough to keep their economies afloat and not default on their debt. Indeed after the Sovereign debt cycle the ECB one way or another bought massive amount of their debt to keep them from defaulting but that was a band-aid that only postponed their demise.\n",

            "Now, there is a Covid-related vast debt buying program that the ECB is doing but it's gonna end soon. Keep in mind the ECB, by charter, can't buy debt of Sovereign countries because it's totally independent and this is why a massive crisis will happen in Europe. I try to explain. Until now the ECB kept these countries from failing with different emergency buying programs and there were never inflationary pressures so interest rates were held below zero. Now inflation is above 8%, the ECB (contrary to the FED) has only one goal: to keep the inflation around 2%. So they have to raise interest rates and can't keep find excuses to buy Sovereign debt and expand their massive balance sheet because otherwise inflation will keep go higher and they would not respect their charter (by law they can't do it).\n",

Debt spreads between EU countries will rise and a new big Sovereign debt crisis (much bigger than the one in 2011/2012) will emerge threatening the survivability of the euro itself because Europe would need two different monetary policies (a lax one in the South, and a hawkish one in the North) but they only have one central bank.\n",

The thing is, in the current interconnected world, already experiencing commodities price pressure, you can't ban the commodities from Russia (after you already did it with Iran and Venezuela) without ruining our economies too. By trying to ruin Russian economy, we'll ruin our economy and crash the stock market.

            "I am lost with the sentiment on this sub and curious folks true thoughts on the markets. I am not a financial analysis, I don’t even work in finance. I can, for the most part, read the 3 sheets, and have an understanding of the basics of corporate finance (again, not an expert). When covid hit, stocks dropped sharply (no brainer). Then, shortly after the initial drop, money poured into safer, large cap tech stocks. I mean poured. For example, from the end of March 2020 (post-crash) till early august, Apple almost doubled in value from their Covid low, and increased some 50-60% in value from their pre-Covid value. That’s insane for a blue chip stock in just a few months. This wasn’t due to some fundamental change in earnings or the way Apple operated. I very much took it as investors moving their money to Covid-safe companies. And we saw this occur in a number of companies that heavily weight the S&amp;P. These gains continued until mid-2021, and in some cases, companies had strong earnings to warrant some of the gains in valuations (well in a lot of cases a LOT of companies posted strong earnings).\n",
            "\n",
            "My long winded point is that valuations grew for the majority of the market from speculation, or movement of money to stocks based on safety and risk, not from strong fundamentals. From a very high level view (without taking into account any technical analysis, because again, I’m not analyst), it would make sense the market corrects to a large degree, at some point. And by correct, I mean affect the boys, not just the shit speculative stocks we saw deflate this past year. I’m lost on the sentiment on why this is surprising, why anyone could disagree with the valuations (again, Apple for example gaining some 60% pre-Covid value, just a few short months after the sharp drop) being inflated. I see people arguing companies strongly quarterly or annual earnings. But it cannot justify a near 130% gain (ie, Apple) in a year and a half. It’s as if we almost forgot the tremendous gain these companies felt after the covid drop, from simply being safe tech stocks. My thesis: even at 20% discount over the last 8 or whatever months, the NASDAQ is still overvalued\n",

Now, the tightening is seemingly priced in and the average PE ratio is around 21 in the SP500 (in December it was around 25). This PE ratio is closer to the 10-year median of about 20 which is why I've begun my DCAing into the falling market.

It is impossible to know tho.\\n\\nSecond: With inflation and world events, there are a lot of things to worry. A 13% dip in the S&amp;P500 is just a correction. Things can get a lot worse. There was an upvoted post, saying that the sentiment on AAII was at the bottom of 2009. What they are not telling you, is have you invest at a similar level in 2008, you would have lost 43%.
